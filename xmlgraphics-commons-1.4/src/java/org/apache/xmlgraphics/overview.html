<TITLE>Apache XML Graphics Commons Overview</TITLE>
<BODY>
<P>Apache XML Graphics Commons is a library in which the two XML Graphics subprojects 
(Apache Batik and Apache FOP) extracted components which are used by both codebases.
The goal is to create a clean dependency hierarchy and to make components more visible
which can be usable separately (i.e. without Batik and FOP).</P>
